# nvidia-wayland-controller

A script to control Nvidia GPUs' Fans and Wattage under Wayland.

## Running

This is mostly an inefficient hack at this point so it's likely not usable.
To run it just `sudo python script.py`

## "Roadmap"

There is still a lot to fix and test, I need to define the configuration externally, as well as creating a script to run at startup.

I would also like to explore GPU and VRAM Overclocking when it will be available on Wayland and some "harder" approaches to safety like defining shutdown temperatures and such.
